define print function that take a lower, increment and upper parameters
	While the lower is less than or equal to the upper
		print the lower
		add the increment to the lower
define a printf function that has functionality similar to that in C
	Print the line with the format requested

if there are not the correct number of arguments OR invalid argument
    print error message
    exit the program



if argument -f is there
	find the formating wanted
	While the lower is less than or equal to the upper
		call printf to print the format requested
if argument -s is there 
	Find the string added after the -s flag
	While the lower is less than or equal to the upper bound
		print the lower bound followed by the seperator
	exit the program
if argument -w is there
	Consider if the string has an increment argument
	find the max length of the upper bound
	While the lower is less than or equal to the upper bound
		print the strings so the width of each string is equal to max length
	exit the program
if arguemnt -v is there
	prints the version of sequ
	exit the program

if there are less than 2 arguments
	print error message
	exit the program

if the length does not have an argument flag(i.e less than or equal to 3 arguments
	Try
		Casting the arguments to integers
		call the print function
	catch
		If you cannot make the cast conversion
		Print error message
		exit the program
