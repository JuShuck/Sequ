create a numeral map that will be used for the roman seq

define print function that take a lower, increment and upper parameters
	While the lower is less than or equal to the upper
		print the lower
		add the increment to the lower
define a printf function that has functionality similar to that in C
	Print the line with the format requested

define a maxWidth function that takes a lower increment and upper parameters
	use a holder to hold the maxwidth of the sequence
	if the increment is 0 return the width as 0
	while lower is less than or equal to the upper
		check to see if the width of lower is bigger than the holder
		increment the lower with the increment variable
	return the max width

define a function that will verify if the input is a float or int
	try casting to an int
	return the argument if you can cast it to an int
	OTHERWISE try casting to a float
	return argument if you can cast it to a float
	OTHERWISE it was an invalid input. exit the program.

define a verify increment function to see if the increment is less than or equal to 0.
	check to see if its less than or equal to 0
		exit the program with an error message

define a printPad function that will pad the left hand side with a special character.
	while the lower is less than or equal to the upper
		print the lower using 'rjust' with the padding character and using the max width
		increment the lower variable with the increment

if there is a backslash for the -s/seperate argument
      if the string is a \n set it in the proper form
      if the string is a \t set it in the proper form

create the implementation for the words function. 
      find the length of the given string
      from 0 to the word length

      print the final string

create an character to int function
	try turning the character to an integer
	if you cant, return an error
	return the integer

create a int to character function
	return numerical value of the character

create a mismatching bounds function
	if the lower and upper are both upper-case
		do nothing
	else if the lower and upper are both lower-case
		do nothing
	otherwise return an error

define a print alpha sequence
	if the lower and upper arguments are 'lower case'
		print lower in lower case
		increment the lower
	else if the lower and upper arguments are 'upper case'
		print lower in upper case
		increment the lower
	else
		error, mismatching bounds
define an int to roman function
	if the number is less than or equal to zero
		error
	while there is valid input in the numeral map
		find the number that fits into the integer
		append it to a list
		subtract the number from the input
	return the list as a string

define a roman to int function
	turn the input in unicode
	while there is a valid input in the numeral map
		find the numeral and add the integer value to a result variable
	return the result

define a print roman sequence
	while lower is less than or equal to upper
		print the output as roman
		increment the lower

define a function that will turn the contents of a file into a list
	try finding the file
		if its found then put each line into a list
	otherwise
		exit the program

handle the -n flag that has input [-n FILE],[-n lower FILE],[-n lower increment FILE]
	assign the list value by calling a function
